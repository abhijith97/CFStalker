A small node.js script that can be run on the command line to find out the submissions of other people on codeforces on the basis of the the difficulty of the question. We can also get to know what which class of questions the problem belong to and many other information.

Ensure you have the module "request" installed. Then run the command as:

nodejs cf.js [codeforces handle] [letter of the problem]

Cheers!
